I've recently been enjoying refreshing my Ruby testing & design skills, and these 3 talks have been excellent. They're not new talks; I've seen some of them before. It never hurts to be reminded about good design and good practices!

### The Magic Tricks of Testing

**Watch it because:** the rules for unit testing minimalism are actually kind of simple - we just need to remember them!

### Yay! Mocks!
#### Corey Haines

**Watch it because:** Listen to your tests! If you're finding pain in your tests, it's a compelling reason to rethink your design. Also cats.

### Refactoring from Good to Great
#### Ben Orenstein

**Watch it because:** `vim` ninja! The entire talk is done inside `vim`. Highly practical, and good arguments for keeping your public interfaces understandable.
