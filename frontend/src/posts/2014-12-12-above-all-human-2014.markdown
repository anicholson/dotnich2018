This past week I got the opportunity to attend the inaugural [Above All Human][1] conference, held in North Melbourne’s Arts House Meat Market. Here are some thoughts & reflections I took out of it.

## tl;dr
- There are lots of conversations we’re not having as an industry. Ethics, diversity and responsibility often end up subservient to pragmatism, profit, and monoculture.
- “Solving a problem” is a very broad statement. Some people’s problems are finding shoes that fit; others are finding capital to finance their businesses in places with no banking infrastructure. Others just want to find cool links on the Internet.
- Just because people are internet-famous and can start cool businesses, doesn’t guarantee that they have insight to share.
- Listen to people who are not like yourself, and you will learn.

## Highlights
**[Bronwen & Susan’s opening remarks][6]**

**Morning keynotes** Perhaps I was just more awake in the morning, but I felt it was the best part. The morning keynote-ish talks were awesome, and I’ll give them some air time of their own.

**[#aah14][5]** The conversations happening on twitter were amazing, and having MC [@mpesce][4] actively participating helped those back-channel interactions feed back into the main show.

**Diversity of speakers** One of the organisers’ stated goals was to have a diverse lineup, across genders & cultures. I think they did a great job of that. The only piece missing were older people. There is a wealth of wisdom in the older voices in tech that would have been great to see there.

**The venue** all the tech conferences I’ve attended in Melbourne have been, sadly, a touch on the bland side. But the Meat Market was a great venue, and the mingling space outside the auditorium was a fun place to hang out, chat, and get refueled.

## Lowlights
**VC panel** I was really interested in the questions being asked of the VC guests - about diversity in VC funding, approaches Australian companies can take in a smaller pond of money, and why an “exit” is pretty much the only strategy VC seems to be interested in.

Their answers? “I’ll fund what appeals to me”, “maybe you **should** just go to the Valley”, and “because 1000x, duh”.

A sad irony that those keen to invest in “innovation”, etc. feel no need (or interest) to innovate their own practices. What would disrupting the VC space look like?

**YC Office Hours** This was a strange segment - designed to mimic the YC pitching sessions, but on stage in front of an audience. It felt a bit like free advertising for YCombinator, and (even more oddly) most of the pitching companies didn’t seem that interested in their advice anyway. If I’d made any of those companies I suppose I’d be defensive of my baby too - but it made for a strange (voyeuristic?) experience.

## Conclusion
Thanks to [Bronwen][7] & [Susan][8] for organising a wonderful conference. We need more of these conversations in our industry. Well done & see you next year!
