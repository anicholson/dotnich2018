Hi everyone!

Another year has been and gone, and now 2015 extends before us as the Not Yet becomes the Has Been.

I have a few goals this year:

* Say ‘no’ to more, and finish the ‘yeses’
* Build routine
* Tell more stories, better.

To achieve this, I’m limiting myself to the following <s>two</s>  three simple rules:

> * You get **one project** a month.
> * You **have to finish** that project within the month.
> * **Tell the story** of that project, **good or bad**. “I just didn’t” makes a terrible story.

Like an agile project, I’ll maintain a backlog of projects, and if I choose to prioritise them then well and good. But during the month, I’ll focus just on that project.

Let’s see what happens :)

## Projects

1. Baby Sleep Monitor
	* [Iteration 0][1]
2. [Raspberry Pi-based MIDI Synthesiser][2]

3. [Kiva Snapshot][3]
